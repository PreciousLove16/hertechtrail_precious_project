My name is Precious Love, A Frontend Web Developer student with HerTechTrail Academy Cohort 6 Starter Track. For my Capstone Project, I was tasked to design a Portfolio Website which is aimed at showcasing my skills and proficiency in the Basic frontend languages like, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.



The whole experience has been exhilarating despite the challenges I faced putting it together. I started out by trying to come up with a theme that would appeal to users visually as well as a responsive interface. This I achieved by reaching out to friends and getting their opinions after mapping out the structure using HTML and styling the basics with CSS.



I also struggled with making my page responsive across different screen sizes, hence my applying responsive frameworks like bootstrap which has pre-designed components that aids responsiveness across all screens and eased the workload.



I used Javascript to enhance, implement and activate interactive elements like modal pop ups. 



During the course of this project, I gained solid understanding of the various coding languages and how to effectively apply them to my webpage. I also learned how to debug and maneuver technical challenges that came with writing long codes. I became grounded in using research and leveraging mentorship to achieve milestone projects.





In summary i've had a rewarding and thrilling journey at HerTechTrail. Its been a bout of excitement, creativity and continuous learning.



I want to thank HerTechTrail for this rare opportunity and for creating a safe space for women to aim for the moon and live their dreams. To my coaches Jesse Josiah Nkemdili Ezike Edozie Magdalene  for their patience and guidance in the course of my learning journey. To the brain behind HerTechTrail madam Gloria Ojukwu, thank you for daring to dream of a time when women will compete effectively in the tech space. I am truly blessed to have been a part of this program.
